# Time-Series-Analysis---Chemical-Mechanical-Polishing
This C project focuses on analyzing time series data from a Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) process used in the semiconductor industry. The goal is to predict and analyze the average material removal rate of a wafer (semiconductor surface) during polishing.
